# Word Guess Game (Browser)

<!-- TODO: add one sentence overview here of your progress -->

Tried to get the structured functions to work to no avail.

## Overview

<!-- TODO: add a description of your assignment, theme, approach, and solution here -->

I tried to make a hangman game based on the Metal Gear Solid Playstatin video game. I tried researching code that would make the functions work for me based on what I could find on google. I went through the steps and tried to complete the task based on the sections provided. I wrote out formulas which I believe to be close, but I can't get the _ _ _ _ to show or the letters being typed to appear. 

## Functionality Breakdown
